# Python Password manager
Password manager with CRUD operations created using Python

# # Versions

There are 2 versions:

* cli is the command line version (limited functionality)

* gui is the graphical version created using TkInter (up to date)


# # Run

Create a file called hash.txt that stores hashed master password (can use hash.py file)

Run either the cli.py (old) or the gui.py (suggested)


# # Note


Note: Meant to be a personal project to learn Python, do not actually use it as it has security issues
